## Creating a Depositor App

### The Easy Way: Extend the FishDepositor contract

App developer can make their apps into a fish burning app by extending the `FishDepositor` contract like so:

```solidity

import "MutantDAO/fishsink/src/FishDepositor.sol"

contract MyContract is FishDepositor {
  // The FishDepositor constructor will accept a pointer to the fishbank contract
  // and the maintainers wallet address which will be allowed to claim fish rewards for this app.
  // The wallet address must be separate from the app address.
  constructor(address _fishBank) FishDepositor(_fishBank, 0x111111111111111111111111111111111111111111) {}

  function takeMyFish(uint256 _amount){
    // This interacts with the `_fishBankContract` which causes the `_amount` in fish to be transferred to the contract.
    _doFishDeposit(_amount);
  }
}

```

## Interacting with the FishBank

### Check the balance of your app maintainer rewards

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _app) public return (uint256)
```

### Find out the current maintainer for the app.

```solidity
function maintainerOf(address _app) public return (address)
```

### Claiming rewards

To claim your rewards from the fishBank the relavent maintainer address should be connected to etherscan and the `withdrawal` function called.

```solidity
function doWithdraw(address _app) public
```

This will send your app rewards to your wallet.

## Admin functions

### Withhold reward access

Connect the owner wallet to etherscan.

Run the following contract method on the Fishbank contract to block withdrawal for a particular app:

```solidity
function blockMaintainer(address _app) public onlyOwner;
```

To set a new withdrawal address for an app you can use the `setMaintainer` function:

```solidity
function setMaintainer(address _app, address _maintainer) public onlyOwner;
```

### Halt contract

This will cause all deposits to fail and lock withdrawals. Funds will be able to be withdrawn by the owner only.

Connect the owner wallet to etherscan.

```solidity
function toggleEmergency() public onlyOwner;
```

Now you can withdraw the funds and reallocate them as required. This method will not work when it is not an emergency.

```solidity
function withdrawEmergency(uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner;
```
